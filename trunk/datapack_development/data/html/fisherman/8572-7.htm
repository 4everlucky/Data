<body>How to Fish: <br>
You must master the techniques of reeling and pumping in order to catch higher-level fish.<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> Please note: You cannot fully utilize your skills if your reeling and pumping levels are 3 or more levels higher than your fishing expertise! </font><br>
But that's not all that's involved in catching higher-level fish. You'll need a new fishing rod, too!<br>
Our guild offers a wide variety of fishing rods in all price ranges! Any guild member can help you select a new one when you're ready!<br>
Mastering the techniques and having the right equipment! These are the keys to the fourth stage of mastering fishing!<br>
