<tr><td>Young Orc, have you seen an animal called the</td></tr> 
<tr><td><font color="LEVEL">kasha bear</font>? It is a poor animal polluted by</td></tr> 
<tr><td>kasha,  the  evil  spirit  of  death  and</td></tr> 
<tr><td>decomposition. Animals polluted by evil spirits</td></tr> 
<tr><td>die slowly because of the curse. However, that</td></tr> 
<tr><td>is not the only problem. The curse is terrible</td></tr> 
<tr><td>because it can be spread to other animals.</td></tr>
<br> 
<tr><td>They gray bears are the greatest guardian</td></tr> 
<tr><td>totems of the Hestui tribe. Our tribe has been</td></tr> 
<tr><td>consecrating the gray bears since ancient</td></tr> 
<tr><td>times. However, as gray bears recently became</td></tr> 
<tr><td>contaminated by the evil spirit kasha, the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>status of our tribe has been trampled to the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>ground, and not one day passes when we can</td></tr> 
<tr><td>sleep in peace.</td></tr> 
<br>
<tr><td>We are working on purifying kasha bears, but I</td></tr> 
<tr><td>don't think you can take charge of this task</td></tr> 
<tr><td>yet.</td></tr>
