Blacksmith Pushkin:
<br>
Nice to meet you, traveler. I am Blacksmith Pushkin.
<br>
I have just finished renovating my workshop and am open for business. You should consider yourself lucky, I can't count how many potential clients I had to turn away while I was fixing up the place. Well now, what can I do for you?
