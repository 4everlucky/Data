<tr><td>Young one, do you know of the Monks that</td></tr> 
<tr><td>carry out the teachings of Paagrio to achieve</td></tr> 
<tr><td>ultimate strength? They do not rely on</td></tr> 
<tr><td>equipment but believe that training their own</td></tr> 
<tr><td>bodies as weapons is the key to acquiring</td></tr> 
<tr><td>ultimate power. For this, they practice the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Kabart, a traditional martial art of the Orcs that</td></tr> 
<tr><td>has been passed on for thousands of years.</td></tr>
<br> 
<tr><td>The training process of a Monk is a perilous</td></tr> 
<tr><td>path that can only be taken by one with faith</td></tr> 
<tr><td>like a flame and a strong body like steel.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>However, the strength you acquire as a result</td></tr> 
<tr><td>is indeed amazing. Kabart Masters can strike</td></tr> 
<tr><td>down a large beast with one blow, using no</td></tr>
<tr><td>swords or axes, just swift movements and</td></tr> 
<tr><td>precise blows.</td></tr>
