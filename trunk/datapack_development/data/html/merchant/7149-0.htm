<tr><td>Among the many battles with the Dark Elves,</td></tr> 
<tr><td>the  fiercest  battle  took  place  in  the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Underground Fortress. The last battle between</td></tr> 
<tr><td>the two races happened there. The blood of</td></tr> 
<tr><td>the injured from both sides ran red on the floor</td></tr> 
<tr><td>of the fortress, and crows covered the skies.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Suddenly, the gates of hell opened and the</td></tr> 
<tr><td><font color="LEVEL">drevanuls</font>, devils from hell, spilled forth. The</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Dark Elven magicians, driven into a corner, had</td></tr> 
<tr><td>called upon these bloodthirsty devils.</td></tr>
<br> 
<tr><td>Hundreds of Elves and Dark Elves alike were</td></tr> 
<tr><td>cruely slain in the Underground Fortress in a</td></tr> 
<tr><td>bloody,  evil  feast  of  insanity.  Luckily  I</td></tr> 
<tr><td>survived, but I still suffer from nightmares. One</td></tr> 
<tr><td>day, I will avenge the deth of my brothers who</td></tr>
<tr><td>died at the hands of the devils.</td></tr>
