Maestro Reorin:<br>
hiccup...Do you really mean that?  Do you really wish to help?!  Well, there might be something you can do...hiccup...<br>
Death Lord Hallate kept my wife's soul hostage in a soul ore.  I heard that he gave this ore to one of his minions.  If you could, please, find <font color="LEVEL">Shilen’s Messenger Cabrio</font> who is holding my wife's soul orb.<br>
Of course, if you can do this for me, I will try to reward you as best I can.  I shall create a weapon for you, like the ones I made in my former glory!  It will be more powerful than you ever imagined!...hiccup...Oh, and I will give you a unique item, the Star of Destiny, which is said to be able to change your life..pfff...it didn't work for me...hiccup
Does this sound like a deal to you?<BR>
