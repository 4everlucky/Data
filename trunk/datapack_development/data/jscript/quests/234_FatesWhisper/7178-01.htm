Trader Zenkin:<br>
Hello there!  I knew you'd be coming.  You are looking for Leorin's Mold, aren't you?  It's true, he sold it to me once...but I'm a trader, not a warehouse keeper!  I'm afraid I have already sold it to someone...<br>
Well, I don't normally do this but...since you really need it, the person I sold it to is <font color="LEVEL">Magister Kaspar</font> of Hardin's Academy.  You can try asking him for it...he might be willing to exchange it with you for some favor.  Good luck, then.
