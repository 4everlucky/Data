Maestro Reorin:<br>
Are you here to listen to a drunkard's story?  You are one of few...I once had it all!  I had enough adena that I never needed to work again. I could have retired with my lovely wife to a life of leisure. I was highly respected by all, but still I wanted more. I dreamed of creating a masterpiece that would go down in history. It was all I could think of. It even kept me awake at night! Soon I became as a man possessed, ignoring my apprentices and worst of all my adoring wife. In the midst of this obsession, demons whispered in my ear their words of temptation...<br>
The evil Death Lord Hallate made me an offer that I couldn't refuse. He promised me that he would help me to create a masterpiece that would go down in history.  But he tricked me...I lost everything!  He took my beloved wife and trapped her soul.  When the Black Anvil Guild learned of my actions, they expelled me.  And now...here I am, alone, drinking my pain away, regretting how I left this demon take my wife's soul as his...Oh, if only I could do something to free her.<br>
