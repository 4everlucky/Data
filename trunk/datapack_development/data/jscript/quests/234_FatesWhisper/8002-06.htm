Maestro Reorin:<br>
At last, the Infernium Scepter is back at my hands.  Look how the evil resonates!  It is unbelievable how obsessed I was, not to have noticed it as I was creating it!<br>
Before I can erase my sins of the past, I need to break its enchantment.  In order to do that, I will need the Imfernium Varnish.  Please go to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Freightman Cliff</font> and get some for me.
