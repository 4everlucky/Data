Paagrio Lord Kakai:
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Paagrio Monks</font>are priests who devote themselves to the path of flame. Unlike Orc Marauders, they do not rely on swords or large weapons, but use their own bodies as weapons of war. Because they do not depend on weapons or armor, they learn many skills to protect themselves.
<br>
The finest Paagrio Monks are selected to become <font color="LEVEL">Paagrio Crusaders</font>, for still more advanced physical and technical training.
