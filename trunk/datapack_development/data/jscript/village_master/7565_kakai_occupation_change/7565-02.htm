Paagrio Lord Kakai:
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Orc Marauders</font> are superb warriors who fight powerfully with weapons. They rely on their pure power and skill to win, not on tactical tricks. Orc Marauders are the most consistent fighters on the battlefield. Their power overwhelms the skills of their enemies.
<br>
The most skillful Orc Marauders are later selected as <font color="LEVEL">Destroyers</font>. One on one, Destroyers surpass all other Fighters.
