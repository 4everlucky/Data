Well, you honestly carried out all tasks!<br>

Many years ago we traded with the Talking Island. 
We obtained ore and made from it armors and swords. 
But only humans could give them the magic force. 
This was the union of dwarf’s craftsmanship and human mind. 
But human ships began to disappear without leaving a trace. 
The humans accused us of theft and sinking of their ships. 
That is why we decided to break the Great Trade Union.<br>

But for a long time the stranger settled and began to live in our lands. 
He is reticent. They say, he is one of the sailor saved from Gillian’s ship. 
My daughter – <font color="LEVEL">Silvera</font> - will show you the road.<br>

Good bye!<br><br>
