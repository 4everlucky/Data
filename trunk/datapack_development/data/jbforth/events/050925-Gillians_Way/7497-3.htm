Really? Oh, I see you decided to search your father? 
I’m afraid, I can tell nothing to you about your father, 
because I have left the ship during a storm the first. 
I am sorry. All that remained at me in memory of your father is the 
Gillian’s Diary. But very much for a long time I have sold it to elven magician. 
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Village</font> and find the magician 
<font color="LEVEL">Asterios</font>.<br>
 
When you will receive <font color="LEVEL">Gillian’s Diary</font>, go to the 
<font color="LEVEL">Giran</font> and give the 
Gillian’s Diary to the <font color="LEVEL">Magister Maurius</font>. <br>

Good luck!
