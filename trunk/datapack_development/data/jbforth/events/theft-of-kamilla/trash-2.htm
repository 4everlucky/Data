So, lady Kamilla have been stolen by <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord</font>.

Now she is in the old deserted castle on the North. 

This place is called the <font color="LEVEL">Bandit Stronghold</font>.

There is <font color="LEVEL">Orator of Revelation</font> next to the gates of the castle.

If you will say him the <font color="LEVEL">password "inferno"</font>, he will open the gates to you. 

You will be able to attack suddenly. Good luck!<br>

Ha-ha!!!<br>
