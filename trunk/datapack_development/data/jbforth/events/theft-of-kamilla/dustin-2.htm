Thank you! You are so lavish knight! 
So, it became known, that the one stranger knows where is lady Kamilla. 
His name is <font color="LEVEL">Trash</font>. He hides hereabout. I think, 
he is still in the <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font>. 
You should find him and ask where and who had concealed lady Kamilla. 
After the rescuing of lady Kamilla return to the <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Maximillian</font> for the reward.
May the Einhasad help you!
