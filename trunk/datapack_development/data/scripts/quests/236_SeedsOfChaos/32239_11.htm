Mother Nornil:<br><br>
Great one...<br><br>
I remember your parents.<br><br>
I remember your birth.<br><br>
I remeber when you left these shores for the Outer World.<br><br>
And I remember when you returned to this island of ours.<br><br>
Many before you refused to walk this path.<br><br>
But you are unafraid to step boldy into the dangerous and unclear future. Truly you are Kamael of the Kamael!<br><br>
