First sorry for my English, maybe someone can correct this.

With the new sql folder structure its in choice of any server-admin to choice his way. 
We will support both to run with newest server version anytime  its possible.
For the stable tables like, characters, items, accounts and so on, we will add files with querys into update folder.


sql-experimental  --  Into the experimental folder, we will put anything wich looks like official.
	Experimental includes much stuff from c2 and c3, but its not really like official stuff.
	The spawnlist-sexy and the location-sexy already unused, feel free to chose it, but we dont give support on it.

sql-checked  --  In the checked folder, we will just have stuff 95% like official.
	Checked includes most data from c1, and its really close to the official.



(we are still working on any of this files, if you find a bug or double spawn into checked or experimental files. Tell us!)

NOTE:
If you will use the experimental, use also the experimental tools.
Else use the checked tools, this bat and sh are already updatet to this changes.
