Sage Cronos:<br>What did you say?  A fairy stone delux will break when it is smeared with blood…?  Gosh, this must be a really fastidious stone.  By the way, what’s up with you…  If Byron told you not to engage in combat, you should have followed his instructions…  What a bummer!  Oh well…  what’s the point of telling this to an adventurer like yourself.  I’m just wasting my breath.   Aren’t you tired by now?  What do you think?  I think you should just give up on making a fairy stone delux and just focus on creating a regular fairy stone.  It’s easier to make and easier to carry around…  huh?  What do you say?<br><a action="bypass -h Quest 420_LittleWings 7610_6">Decide to make a fairy stone.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest 420_LittleWings 7610_7">Decide to make a fairy stone delux.</a></body></html>
