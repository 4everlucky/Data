Maestro Reorin:<br>
Great!  Now for the last step: Infernium has a very harmful aura around you.  In order to neutralize it and make it useful, you must melt a strong weapon along with it.  The result will, of course, be a much stronger weapon, so it is well worth the cost.  In any case, go find any one of the best B Grade weapons and bring it to me.  Make sure it is among the best in the market, but even if the weapon you bring me has special abilities or enchantments, the result won't be any better.  It will still work just the same, but I'd use a plain weapon if I were you.<br>
Just let me know when you are ready.  I will be waiting.
