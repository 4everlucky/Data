Maestro Leorin sent you?  Is that so?  It's really ashame to see what he turned himself into.  He had so much talent.  Well, I'm glad he is making an effort to turn back to his good self!  Here is the Infernium Varnish that you needed.  I hope it helps.  Give my regards to Leorin when you give it to him!
