Maestro Reorin:<br>
Oh, my beloved wife's soul orb is back to my hands!  Her soul can finally be free!  This is the first time I can feel some joy since...<br>
I'm sorry, I am afraid I have one more request of you.  Before I can craft you the weapon as I promised, I need you to help me restore my honor by collecting my last masterpiece back from the demons who took it and undoing its curse.  Please say you will help me again.<BR>
