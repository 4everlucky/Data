Maestro Reorin:<br>
My last masterpiece, the Infernium Scepter, was broken in 3 pieces and shared among three demons who live in different floors of the Tower of Insolence.<br>
First, of course, the <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord Hallate</font> has one piece.  The second piece was given to his aide, <font color="LEVEL">Kernon</font>.  The last piece is held by <font color="LEVEL">Longhorn Golkonda</font><br>
Please retrieve the Infernium Scepter pieces from them and bring them to me, so I may undo the evil that was once done.
