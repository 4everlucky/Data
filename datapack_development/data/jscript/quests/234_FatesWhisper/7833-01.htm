Magister Kaspar:<br>
Leorin's Mold is a very unique material and an absolute necessity for the strongest weapons.  I originally bought it as a means to a goal.  You see, I am working on some experiments to achieve immortality.  In order to do my experiments, I need the blood of a strong immortal being...like Baium, the ancient emperor who is sealed in a room atop the Tower of Insolence!  However, nobody was ever brave enough to face him.  You see, it is said that he has gone really mad over the centuries...<br>
Since you want the mold, I'll make you a deal.  Over time, I developped this pipette knife which has a special enchantment on it.  Here, take it.  Try to wake up Baium and stab him a few times with this knife, till his blood turns it red.  Come back to me and I shall give you the Leorin's Mold.<br>
Ah, one more thing.  The entrance to the room where Baium stays is locked.  You will need to talk to Magister Hanellin of Aden Castle Town.  He will tell you how to enter his room.
