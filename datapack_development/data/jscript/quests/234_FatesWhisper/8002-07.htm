Maestro Reorin:<br>
The Infernium Varnish!  You really have done me great favor by bringing this to me.  Now I can once and for all cleanse my sins by neutralizing the magic on this scepter. Now, I am ready to give up drinking and face life again!<br>
I know I promised you a grand weapon as reward...but actually, there are some things of mine I must gather back in order to craft this.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you this earlier, but when I was expelled from the Guild, all my crafting tools were confiscated. <br>
I hope you don't mind...Please go to <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Ferris</font> in Aden Castle Town and ask him to give you my very special hammer.  I'm sure he'll agree if you explain that you helped cleanse my sins.
