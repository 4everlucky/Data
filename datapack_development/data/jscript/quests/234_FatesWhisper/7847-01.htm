Head Blacksmith Ferris:<br>
Maestro Leorin?  Of course I remember him.  He was a top student once but he put shame to our guild with his actions!...<br>
I heard that recently he has been trying to set things right again and restore his honor.  Are you the one who has been helping him?  I guess we all owe you a favor then.  Here, take this.  It is a hammer that Leolin specially designed for his own needs.  I had confiscated it after expelling him from the guild, but if he's back to his old self, he could make good use of it.  You may take it to him now.
