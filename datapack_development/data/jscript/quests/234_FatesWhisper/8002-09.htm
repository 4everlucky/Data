Strike with the hammer!  See the fire burn!  Strike with the hammer!  Make the metal turn!  Hit it again!  Make it melt...hmm...melt?...of course!  How could I forget!<br>
Infernium is very hard to work with.  There is only one way to melt it.  It needs to be processed with <font color="LEVEL">B Grade Crystals</font>.  I remember it took me exactly 984 crystals last time!<br>
Why are you looking at me like that?  Do you think I'm trying to cheat you?  No way!  I am far too greatful of your help.  I am not asking for any payment for this, but this is an important ingredient...so please hurry up and find the crystals so we can finish this and I can repay you for all you've done for me.
