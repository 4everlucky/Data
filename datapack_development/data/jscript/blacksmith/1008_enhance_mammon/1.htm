Ah, so you wish to enhance your weapon! Well, it's the next-best thing to buying a new one, I say...But remember, a higher price doesn't necessarily mean a better product. There are many excellent weapons that are reasonably priced.
<br>
As I'm sure you know, capabilities added to your weapon will not interfere with enchantments.
<br>
You do remember of course that I only accept payment in <font color="LEVEL">ancient adena</font> right?
<br>
Choose the capabilities you wish to add to your weapons!
