#Baium status tracking
ASLEEP = 0  # baium is in the stone version, waiting to be woken up.  Entry is unlocked
AWAKE = 1   # baium is awake and fighting.  Entry is locked.
DEAD = 2    # baium has been killed and has not yet spawned.  Entry is locked

# Boss: Baium
#
# Note1: if the server gets rebooted while players are still fighting Baium, there is no lock, but
#   players also lose their ability to wake baium up.  However, should another person
#   enter the room and wake him up, the players who had stayed inside may join the raid.
#   This can be helpful for players who became victims of a reboot (they only need 1 new player to
#   enter and wake up baium) and is not too exploitable since any player wishing to exploit it
#   would have to suffer 5 days of being parked in an empty room.
# Note2: Neither version of Baium should be a permanent spawn.  This script is fully capable of
#   spawning the statue-version when the lock expires and switching it to the mob version promptly.
#
# Additional notes ( source http://aleenaresron.blogspot.com/2006_08_01_archive.html ):
#   * Baium only first respawns five days after his last death. And from those five days he will
#       respawn within 1-8 hours of his last death. So, you have to know his last time of death.
#   * If by some freak chance you are the only one in Baium's chamber and NO ONE comes in
#       [ha, ha] you or someone else will have to wake Baium. There is a good chance that Baium
#       will automatically kill whoever wakes him. There are some people that have been able to
#       wake him and not die, however if you've already gone through the trouble of getting the
#       bloody fabric and camped him out and researched his spawn time, are you willing to take that 
#       chance that you'll wake him and not be able to finish your quest? Doubtful.
#       [ this powerful attack vs the player who wakes him up is NOT yet implemented here]
#   * once someone starts attacking Baium no one else can port into the chamber where he is.
#       Unlike with the other raid bosses, you can just show up at any time as long as you are there
#       when they die. Not true with Baium. Once he gets attacked, the port to Baium closes. byebye,
#       see you in 5 days.  If nobody attacks baium for 30 minutes, he auto-despawns and unlocks the 
#       vortex
