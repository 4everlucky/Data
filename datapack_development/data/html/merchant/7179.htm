Oh my, do you happen to be a Knight? Knights are the best adventurers, don't you think?
<br>
If the Knights of the castle protects us, we are not afraid of an invasion by Elmore or any crazy Mystic from the Ivory Tower. This is because Knights are invincible. Don't you think so?
<br>
Hmm, you don't talk much do you...
