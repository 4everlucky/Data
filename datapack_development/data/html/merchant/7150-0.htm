<tr><td>Trader Herbiel:</td></tr>
<br> 
<tr><td>A long time ago, there was a beautiful forest</td></tr> 
<tr><td>beyond the mountains to the east of the Elven</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Forest. We Elves used to live there. But the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>land became devastated due to the forbidden</td></tr> 
<tr><td>magic that was used two thousand years ago</td></tr> 
<tr><td>during the war between the Humans and the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Elves. Now it is called the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>.</td></tr>
<br> 
<tr><td>Today, the problem is that the Sea of Spores is</td></tr> 
<tr><td>slowly expanding bit by bit. Of course, we are</td></tr> 
<tr><td>trying to stop its expansion with a magical</td></tr> 
<tr><td>defence field, but our forest has become</td></tr> 
<tr><td>gradually  contaminated  over  hundreds  of</td></tr> 
<tr><td>years, from the poisons that seep out of the</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Sea of Spores. We are all trying our best to</td></tr> 
<tr><td>solve the problem, but it is not an easy thing to</td></tr>
<tr><td>do. There may be a day when I will require</td></tr>
<tr><td>your assistance.</td></tr>
