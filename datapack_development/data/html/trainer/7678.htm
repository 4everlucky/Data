Blacksmith Helton:
<br>
Who are you? What do you want? If you don't have a barrel of nice Dwarven beer I don't want to talk to you.
<br>
I thought the life of a blacksmith would be exciting, but it is all heating, hammering, bending and cooling.  I wish I could spend more time making shiny armor and sharp blades!
