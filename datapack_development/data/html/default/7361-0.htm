<tr><td>All spirits in the ancient forest used to be</td></tr> 
<tr><td>friends to us Elves. But recently, some spirits</td></tr> 
<tr><td>have become violent. It's as if they were trying</td></tr> 
<tr><td>to get revenge on the Elves for the destruction</td></tr> 
<tr><td>of the forest. I heard it was the angry wind</td></tr> 
<tr><td>spirit 'lirein' tht recently caused the strong</td></tr> 
<tr><td>wind to destroy the roofs of the village</td></tr> 
<tr><td>buildings and break windows.</td></tr> 
<br>
<tr><td>If the 'sylph' is the spirit of the cool breeze</td></tr> 
<tr><td>that blows between trees, then 'lirein' is a</td></tr> 
<tr><td>vengeful spirit of a wild storm. These spirits</td></tr> 
<tr><td>pluck trees from their roots and send animals</td></tr> 
<tr><td>flying high in the air. They are especially</td></tr> 
<tr><td>hostile to Elves. They come and go with severe</td></tr> 
<tr><td>winds, and we feel like they are trying to drive</td></tr> 
<tr><td>us from the forest.</td></tr>
<br> 
<tr><td>However, the 'wind shard,' a fragment of 'soul</td></tr> 
<tr><td>ore' that is within the body of lirein, is a very</td></tr> 
<tr><td>precious resource. I make various magical</td></tr> 
<tr><td>products using soul ore, so I may ask you to</td></tr> 
<tr><td>collect some wind shards for me in the near</td></tr> 
<tr><td>future.</td></tr>
