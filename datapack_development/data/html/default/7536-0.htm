<tr><td>Elder Arin:</td></tr>
<br>
<tr><td>Have you ever traveled by <font color="LEVEL">airship?</font> It is the</td></tr>
<tr><td>ultimate transportation, and we of the Black</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anvil Guild created it with our combined</td></tr>
<tr><td>technology. The sight of the airships flying</td></tr>
<tr><td>high in the sky makes people sigh with</td></tr>
<tr><td>admiration.</td></tr>
<br>
<tr><td>But they say that the flying mechanisms of the</td></tr>
<tr><td>giants of ere were greater in size than those of</td></tr>
<tr><td>today, faster than the wyverns, and could even</td></tr>
<tr><td>fly higher than the clouds, My dream is to</td></tr>
<tr><td>restore the forgotten flying technology of the</td></tr>
<tr><td>giants, I wonder what our land looks like from</td></tr>
<tr><td>the sky, through the clouds ... Doesn't</td></tr>
<tr><td>imagining that just make you happy?</td></tr>
<br>
<tr><td>I am very busy with my guild business, but I try</td></tr>
<tr><td>to study the <font color="LEVEL">floating stones,</font> the basic element</td></tr>
<tr><td>of flight, whenever I get the chance. Floating</td></tr>
<tr><td>stones are a peculiar metal that have the</td></tr>
<tr><td>characteristic of hovering in the air, and I</td></tr>
<tr><td>believe that the key to unlocking the secret of</td></tr>
<tr><td>the giants of ere lies in finding a method to</td></tr>
<tr><td>control the floating stone's powers. But I</td></tr>
<tr><td>always run short of study materials, so I often</td></tr>
<tr><td>ask apprentices like you to collect floating</td></tr>
<tr><td>stones.</td></tr>
