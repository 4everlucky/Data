Fishing Manual:<br>

The best bait for beginners is a very special lure made by the Fishermen's Guild! It contains a mechanism that <font color="LEVEL">notifies the fisherman when to reel in and when to pump, according to the movements of the fish</font>.<br>

This bait only catches a certain kind of fish. If you wish to catch ordinary fish, use an ordinary lure. <br>
